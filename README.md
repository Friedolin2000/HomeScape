# HomeScape

This is a program for a rasperry pi that allowes you to see where your roomates are.
Unfortunately I have no idea how to use eg a google maps api nor any other way to find out the position remotly.

The first screen is an overview with everybody who lives in your house and the place they are. To change the location you press on your section shortly either to say you are home or that you are at a place that a time table suggests.
If you want to select a place yourself press longer.

You can also type in how long you will be away or when you come back, so your roomates know when they can worry that sth happened to you.

If you travel from one place to another without visiting home in between you can also add more places that you will be visiting.

On the main screen will be a countdown when you will return. To give more accurate results data can also be saved and calculated in the countdown. eg when u usually come about 5mins to late the countdown will take care about that.

You can edit or add roommates in settings. Unfortunately if u add places you have to put a png file in the places folder named exactly after the place to see an icon.
